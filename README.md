# gting's environments and configurations

These are my personal environment settings and configuration files; this repo contains everything I use to effectively manage them, including scripts to bootstrap my preferred settings onto new MacOS-based computers (as much as is programatically possible, anyways).

## Dotfiles

All dotfiles are in `dotfiles/`. Run `symlink-all.sh` to symlink each dotfile to its proper location.

## Languages

Contains information to get code environments up and running. For example, for Python I have a list of high-level packages that will automatically capture commonly used Python libraries if I install them into a `uv`-managed environment.
